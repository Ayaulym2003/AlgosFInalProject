# Question 1
Q: What is Dynamic Programming?

A: Dynamic programming is a technique where an algorithmic problem is broken down into subproblems. It is a method of computer programming in which an algorithmic problem is first divided into smaller problems, the outcomes are saved, and then the smaller problems are optimized to find the overall solution, which typically involves determining the algorithmic query's maximum and minimum range.

# Question 2
Q: When should Dynamic Programming be used?

A: When a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

# Question 3
Q: What is the main diffetence between Top-down and Bottom-up approach?

A: Top-down starts from the top of the problem by dividing the problem into subproblems and solving them. Whereas Bottom-up approach starts from bottom, the smallest part of the problem and builds up to the main problem iteratively, storing results in a table.
